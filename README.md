🚀 Lenovo P1 Gen 7 Wi-Fi Fix: Transmit Power Adjustment
📌 Issue Overview
Lenovo P1 Gen 7 laptops may experience screen flickering issues due to an improperly set Wi-Fi Transmit Power level. This issue is commonly found in laptops using Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211, Intel Wi-Fi 7 BE200, or similar adapters.

🛠️ Solution
This PowerShell script automatically adjusts the Transmit Power setting to Medium (50), resolving the screen flickering issue. The script dynamically detects the correct Wi-Fi adapter and applies the fix, ensuring it works for any P1 Gen 7 device.

⚡ How It Works
✅ Detects the correct Wi-Fi adapter registry path.
✅ Modifies Transmit Power (IbssTxPower) to 50 (Medium).
✅ Restarts the Wi-Fi adapter to apply the changes.
✅ Works on any P1 Gen 7 Wi-Fi adapter (Intel, Realtek, etc.).
✅ Can be deployed via PowerShell or PDQ Deploy.

# Define the base registry path for network adapters
$baseRegPath = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}"

# Find all network adapter registry subkeys
$adapters = Get-ChildItem -Path $baseRegPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.PSChildName -match "^\d+$" }

# Loop through each adapter registry key and find the Wi-Fi adapter
foreach ($adapter in $adapters) {
    $adapterProperties = Get-ItemProperty -Path $adapter.PSPath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    
    if ($adapterProperties -and $adapterProperties.DriverDesc -match "Wi-Fi|Wireless") {
        # Found the correct Wi-Fi adapter registry path
        $wifiRegPath = $adapter.PSPath

        # Set the Transmit Power (IbssTxPower) to Medium (50)
        Set-ItemProperty -Path $wifiRegPath -Name "IbssTxPower" -Value "50"
        Write-Output "Transmit Power (IbssTxPower) set to Medium (50) for adapter: $($adapterProperties.DriverDesc)"

        # Restart Wi-Fi adapter using netsh
        $wifiAdapterName = (Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.InterfaceDescription -match "Wi-Fi" }).Name
        if ($wifiAdapterName) {
            Write-Output "Restarting Wi-Fi adapter: $wifiAdapterName"
            Start-Process -FilePath "netsh" -ArgumentList "interface set interface name=`"$wifiAdapterName`" admin=disable" -Wait -NoNewWindow
            Start-Process -FilePath "netsh" -ArgumentList "interface set interface name=`"$wifiAdapterName`" admin=enable" -Wait -NoNewWindow
            Write-Output "Wi-Fi adapter restarted successfully."
        } else {
            Write-Output "Wi-Fi adapter not found or unable to retrieve adapter name."
        }

        break  # Exit loop once the correct adapter is found and modified
    }
}

Write-Output "Script completed successfully."
❓ FAQ
1️⃣ What if my device still flickers after running the script?
Make sure the Transmit Power setting is set to Medium in Device Manager → Network Adapter → Advanced.
