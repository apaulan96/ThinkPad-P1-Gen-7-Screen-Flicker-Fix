üöÄ Lenovo P1 Gen 7 Wi-Fi Fix: Transmit Power Adjustment
üìå Issue Overview
Lenovo P1 Gen 7 laptops may experience screen flickering issues due to an improperly set Wi-Fi Transmit Power level. This issue is commonly found in laptops using Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211, Intel Wi-Fi 7 BE200, or similar adapters.

üõ†Ô∏è Solution
This PowerShell script automatically adjusts the Transmit Power setting to Medium (50), resolving the screen flickering issue. The script dynamically detects the correct Wi-Fi adapter and applies the fix, ensuring it works for any P1 Gen 7 device.

‚ö° How It Works
‚úÖ Detects the correct Wi-Fi adapter registry path.
‚úÖ Modifies Transmit Power (IbssTxPower) to 50 (Medium).
‚úÖ Restarts the Wi-Fi adapter to apply the changes.
‚úÖ Works on any P1 Gen 7 Wi-Fi adapter (Intel, Realtek, etc.).
‚úÖ Can be deployed via PowerShell or PDQ Deploy.
